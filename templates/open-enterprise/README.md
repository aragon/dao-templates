# Open Enterprise template

The Open Enterprise template includes the collection of Aragon apps that enable organizations to curate issues, collectively budget, and design custom reward and bounty programs.

## Usage

Create a new token for the Open Enterprise entity:

```
template.newToken(name, symbol)
```

- `name`: Name for the token used in the organization
- `symbol`: Symbol for the token used in the organization

Create a new Open Enterprise entity:

```
template.newInstance(name, members, votingSettings, financePeriod, useAgentAsVault)
```

- `id`: Id for org, will assign `[id].aragonid.eth`
- `members`: Array of member addresses (1 token will be minted for each member)
- `votingSettings`: Array of `[supportRequired, minAcceptanceQuorum, voteDuration]` to set up the voting app of the organization
- `financePeriod`: Initial duration for accounting periods, it can be set to zero in order to use the default of 30 days.
- `useAgentAsVault`: Use an Agent app as a more advanced form of Vault app

Alternatively, create a new Open Enterprise entity with a Payroll app:

```
template.newInstance(name, members, votingSettings, financePeriod, useAgentAsVault, payrollSettings)
```

- `payrollSettings`: Array of `[address denominationToken , IFeed priceFeed, uint64 rateExpiryTime, address employeeManager (set to voting if 0x0)]` for the Payroll app

## Deploying templates

After deploying ENS, APM and AragonID, just run:

```
npm run deploy:rinkeby
```

The network details will be automatically selected by the `arapp.json`'s environments.
