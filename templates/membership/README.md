# Aragon Membership template

## Usage

Create a new token for the membership entity:

```
template.newToken()
```

- `name`: Name for the token used in the organization
- `symbol`: Symbol for the token used in the organization

Create a new membership entity:

```
template.newInstance(name, members, voteSettings, financePeriod, useAgentAsVault)
```

- `name`: Name for org, will assign `[name].aragonid.eth`
- `members`: Array of member addresses (1 token will be minted for each member)
- `voteSettings`: Array of [voteDuration, supportRequired, minAcceptanceQuorum] for votes by the organization's members
- `financePeriod`: Initial duration for accounting periods
- `useAgentAsVault`: Use an Agent app as a more advanced form of Vault app

## Deploying templates

After deploying ENS, APM and AragonID, just run:

```
npm run deploy:rinkeby
```

The network details will be automatically selected by the `arapp.json`'s environments.
