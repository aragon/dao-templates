# Aragon Company template

## Usage

Create a new token for the company entity:

```
template.newToken()
```

- `name`: Name for the token used in the organization
- `symbol`: Symbol for the token used in the organization

Create a new company entity:

```
template.newInstance(name, holders, stakes, voteSettings, financePeriod, useAgentAsVault)
```

- `name`: Name for org, will assign `[name].aragonid.eth`
- `holders`: Array of token holder addresses
- `stakes`: Array of token stakes for holders (token has 18 decimals, multiply token amount `* 10^18`)
- `voteSettings`: Array of [voteDuration, supportRequired, minAcceptanceQuorum] for votes by the organization's members

- `useAgentAsVault`: Use an Agent app as a more advanced form of Vault app
