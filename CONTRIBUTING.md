# Contributing to Aragon DAO Kits and Templates

:tada: Thank you for being interested in contributing to an Aragon Project! :tada:

The following is a set of guidelines and helpful pointers for contributing to Aragon DAO kits. The keyword here is *guidelines*, not rules. As such, use your best judgement and feel free to propose changes to even this document.

## Code of Conduct

Everyone participating in this project is governed by the [Aragon Code of Conduct](http://wiki.aragon.one/documentation/Code_of_Conduct/). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code as well.

Please report unacceptable behavior to a maintainer through either Twitter or by shooting us an e-mail at contact [at] aragon.one.

## I Just Have A Question

Please don't file an issue with questions. It's easier for you and for us if you go directly to [our chat](https://aragon.chat), since it will keep our repositories clean and you will get a faster response.
